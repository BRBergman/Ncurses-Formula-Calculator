# Ncurses-Formula-Calculator-Thing

its a calculator that does some formulas i guess and uses ncurses to do a gui of sorts

made to compile on mac and should work on linux

i got it to work on windows using wsl but it's not worthwhile to attempt at home because although it compiles and runs fine the editor cant find ncurses as a dependancy
